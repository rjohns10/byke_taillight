/**

    Example implementation of the callback

    This slave driver emulates an EEPROM Device.
    Sequential reads from the EEPROM will return data at the next
    EEPROM address.

    Random access reads can be performed by writing a single byte
    EEPROM address, followed by 1 or more reads.

    Random access writes can be performed by writing a single byte
    EEPROM address, followed by 1 or more writes.

    Every read or write will increment the internal EEPROM address.

    When the end of the EEPROM is reached, the EEPROM address will
    continue from the start of the EEPROM.
